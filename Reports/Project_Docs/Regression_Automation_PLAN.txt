Plan for Implementing Regression Test Automation 

1) Build up a Regression test automation pack based on the existing manual test process/procedures/workflows the defined function areas, live/test website, Web officee, API etc.

2) Interact with the test team to gain their knowledge of the CAT testing processes

3) Interact with the test team, review the implementations of the test automation and test automation processes, feed the test team into the automation process, providing assistance, and familiarisation to the approach and test tooling.  

4) Initialy producing the automation regression test pack against the 'LIVE' CAT deployment.

5) Initialy iterating through builds localy, until the coverage is good and test automation robustness and stability is excellent.

6) Include the regression pack test runs into Devtest and other environments. Bandwidth will be less, so there will be some latency issues to deal with

6) At a point in the future, to include integration of the test automation with the CI, Jenkins, continuos build pipeline.

7) All test covered by automation will be documented within the automation folder structure, under the test folder. A copy of the manual test procedure/process will be stored here, along with the details of the test automation included within those documents.

8) A report on progress will also be available within this folder structure.

9) Detail the linkages between the manual and automation tests, for verification of coverage and for proof of executions and approach.

10) Document code reuse, and provide methods to rapidly create new automation scripts as the automation infrastructure matures
